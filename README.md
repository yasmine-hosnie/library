# 📚 My Library App

A simple and elegant **Library Management Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, track, and manage their personal book collection — directly from the browser with a clean and responsive UI.

## 🧠 Overview

This project simulates a **digital bookshelf** where users can:
- Add books (with title, author, number of pages, and read status)
- Toggle whether a book has been read
- Remove books from the list

Everything updates instantly in the browser using **DOM manipulation** — no backend required.

The app uses a **modal form** for adding new books, creating a smooth and user-friendly experience.
